# Project Proposal
### Project title
CoinMaster

### What and why?
CoinMaster is a cryptocurrency tracker that shows the real-time information on cryptocurrency prices and events. It helps build your portfolio with a few clicks. Users can compare data on different coins and see the latest news. It allows beginners to watch tutorials and learn crypto basics.

This is different from a cryptocurrency exchange platform, since users will not hold their funds on this platform. For example, if you prefer to store your crypto in a hardware wallet but you still want to keep up with price movements throughout the day, choosing CoinMaster is less complicated than signing up for an exchange. 


### For whom?
This is for cryptocurrency **investers** and **beginners**.

* Investors who already have portfolios can use this platfrom for tracking daily news in the global crypto market and optimize their portfolios. 
* Beginners can use CoinMaster to explore without putting actual money into the market. It provides a series of tutorials to help them learn the basics and get familiar with different terms.


### How?
As enter the website, there will be a few feature listed: **Coins**, **Compare**, **Portfolio** and **Learn**. 

1. In **Coins**, you will see ranked cryptocurrencies with live prices. By clicking one of them, you will see a historical chart, and below is all the news relating to it.
